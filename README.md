This project was done in 2019 as part of NTU's Neural Networks course in B. Eng (Computer Science).

#### Project 1

**Part A:** The aim is to classify a Cardiotocography dataset containing measurements of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) features using a feedfoward neural network (includes a hidden layer of 10 neurons with ReLU activation function and an output softmax layer).

**Part B:** This is a regression problem to predict the probability of a student getting an admit into a graduate program, using a Graduate Admission Predicate dataset. The project includes designing a 3-layer feedforward neural network, using mini-batch gradient descent for training and recursive feature elimination to find the optimal features.


#### Project 2

**Part A:** This project involves designing a convolutional neural network, which was trained using mini-batch gradient descent learning. Grid search was used to find the optimal number of feature maps at the convovlution layers.

**Part B:** This projects implements CNN and RNN layers at the word and character levels for the classification of texts from Wikipage entries.
